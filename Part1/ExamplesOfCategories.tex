% expand order section with symmetry table and then define order
Free Construction is the process of completing a given structure by extending it with the minimum number of items to satisfy its laws. Graphs are the free constructor for the Free category. chains of length zero serve as the identity morphism in the free category.

Thin categories are those where Hom-set is the set of morphisms from object a to object b in the category of C written as C(a,b) or HomC(a,b)

A hom-set is the set of morphisms from object $a$ to object $b$ in the category of $C$ written as $C(a,b)$ or $Hom_C(a,b)$
Every hom-set is either empty, a singleton, or a preorder.
Preorders can have cycles where as partial orders cannot

% move this to the Orders section when created
Sorting algorithms like quick-sort, bubble sort, merge sort, only work on total orders. Partial orders use topological sorts
there is at most one morphism going from any object to any other object.
